// This is the place for your statements. The maximum

// less then 50 statements are advisable.
// If your are using German Umlauts and other special
// characters, make sure, that you save this XML-file
// as an UTF-8-document. White-space inbetween the
// nodes are ignored. Any white-space within the text-

// EXAMPLE
// Let's define some statements concerning FlashQ:
// Statement 1: FlashQ is very usefull.
// Statement 2: I prefer offline surveys.
// Statement 3: FlashQ is too complicated to configure.
//
// Each statement requires a seperate statement-node
// consisting out of an opening and a closing tag. The
// statement itself goes between this two tags.
// The unique statement id is saved as an
// attribute called 'id'. We have three exmaple
// statements and we need therefore three statement-
// nodes and one parent-node.
